Badges are not used for non-numeric values. If you have a non-numeric value, use labels instead. Badges work for exact numbers up to 999.
For numbers greater than 999, use K to indicate Thousands (5K for 5.231) and M to indicate Millions (2M for 2.100.523).

We recommend that you review the use cases in the <a href="https://storybook-clayui.netlify.com/?path=/story/claybadge--default">Storybook</a>.
