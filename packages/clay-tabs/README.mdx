## Introduction

`ClayTabs` is a controlled component, we left this component controlled because the user can use Dropdowns or another control to select a `TabPane` for render. Just creating states to manage it.

For the modern variant of Tabs use the `modern` property. If you need to justify the text inside the `ClayTabs.Item`, use the `justified` property.

Use `ClayTabs.Item` for defining a TabPane's trigger. For using this trigger as an `anchor` element, just define `href` property, otherwise, the trigger will be a `button`. Use `ClayTabs.TabPane` for wrapping the content that will be rendered by TabPane as the following example:

<Tabs />

## Dropdown Tabs

As a controlled component, Tabs allows you to control the `active` TabPane. Thereby, we can select the active TabPane by a Dropdown menu. For example:

<TabsDropdown />

## TabPanel

Note that `ClayTabs.TabPanel` is an alias to `ClayTabs.TabPane`. The two are interchangeable.
