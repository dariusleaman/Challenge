It's used when a major or big task has to be divided into smaller task, with the aim of letting the user breath in the process and providing them with a sense of progression.

Each step can have two different states: `active` or `complete` defined by props as you can see below.

## Collapsable Steps

Using `ClayMultiStepNavWithBasicItems` in combination with `maxStepsShown` prop you can collapse the steps that don't fit into a dropdown to ensure good user experience.
