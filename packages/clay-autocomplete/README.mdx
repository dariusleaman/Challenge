## Composing

Autocomplete provides the necessary components for you to compose with the other components, **by itself it does not do much**, you need to use the `<ClayDropDown />` along with `<Autocomplete.DropDown />` and `<Autocomplete.Item />` to create the suggestions.

```jsx
<ClayAutocomplete.DropDown>
	<ClayDropDown.ItemList>
		<ClayAutocomplete.Item match="cl" value="clay" />
	</ClayDropDown.ItemList>
</ClayAutocomplete.DropDown>
```

If you already have the raw data, it is becomes simpler to create an autocomplete but it is important that you **create a filter for your data** according to the value entered in the input element.

```jsx
<ClayAutocomplete>
	<ClayAutocomplete.Input
		onChange={(event) => setValue(event.target.value)}
		value={value}
	/>
	<ClayAutocomplete.DropDown active={showDropDown}>
		<ClayDropDown.ItemList>
			{resourceFiltered.map((item) => (
				<ClayAutocomplete.Item key={item} match={value} value={item} />
			))}
		</ClayDropDown.ItemList>
	</ClayAutocomplete.DropDown>
</ClayAutocomplete>
```

## Loading state

`<ClayAutocomplete.LoadingIndicator />` is used for providing feedback that data is loading in the suggestion box, it communicates with `<ClayAutocomplete.Input />` so that the markup can adjust.

<div class="clay-site-alert alert alert-warning">
	<strong class="lead">Warning</strong>
	Add this when your suggestion data is coming from a data provider.
</div>

<AutocompleteWithLoadingState />

## Data from outside

For cases where you do not have all the data in the client and need to pass the value for the filter to the backend, use the `<ClayDataProvider />` component or `useResource` hook for this.

<AutocompleteWithDataProvider />
