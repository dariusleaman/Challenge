Components that are essential to build interfaces. Each component defines its rules and behaviors. Each component's look and feel is based on the combination our foundations defined in <a href="https://liferay.design/lexicon/core-components/" target="_blank">Lexicon</a>. Therefore, changes to the foundation principles propagate to the entire system. In our case, these components are defined here in Clay.

Some of the components you will find are buttons, text inputs, alerts or tabs among others. A full knowledge about them will allow you to create amazing applications.
